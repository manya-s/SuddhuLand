		Welcome to this corner of the internet, known to a select few as the <b>"SuddhuLand".</b><br>
		There are different parts to this world that you will get to explore soon enough, but before you start your quest, you must acquaint yourself with the legend of this world. (Go to "WORLD"(top-right) when you work here is done)<br>
		<b>Castle of Shade:</b> This is the haunt of the most well known and sought after practioner of deception and forgery. Beware, for their clients include some of the world's most wanted murderes and brutes.
		<br>
		<b>Jonathan:</b> Jonathan is bestest named octupus that you'll ever find.  He might look naive but this three-hearted, blueblooded creature has contemplated some deep questions and even faced his own creator. Follow him to dive deep into his adventourous life.
		<br>
		<b>Cult of Secrecy:</b> The secrets hidden inside this cult are not meant to be seen by any soul except for its members. Current member include you, Sudhang Varshney and me, Manya Singh. Beware of entering into this realm if you have someone beside you, for this is a place where secrets are treasured the most. 
		<br>
		<b>Chamber of Memories:</b> A bright and happy place inside of SuddhuLand where you can find happy memories residing. This place is warm and smells of cookies and vanilla milkshake. It is the place where toffee frappes and first kisses reside. 
		<br>
		<b>The Lone Lady:</b> In the depths of SuddhuLand lurks a lonesome lady, infamous for luring wanderers off their tracks and into her lair. Her beauty is well know even in far off lands. What she shows the wanderers inside her lair is a mystery to this day, but its beauty is known to have driven men out of their minds.
		<br>
		SuddhuLand also hosts <b>the rarest thing in this whole universe</b>. You must find out what it is for yourself.
		<br>
		Like everyplace in this universe, SuddhuLand has an abundance of the <b>"The most abundant thing in the universe."</b> Again, its something that you'll have to find out for yourself.
		<br>
		SuddhuLand also has a vast library, named <b>WhatsApp ke panno se.</b> Enter the library to find out the vast collection of knowledge inside of it.
		<br>
		As you continue on with your journey, you will find a very ordinary looking <b>doggo.</b> But dont let the mundane fool you, for the dog is the master of dark and powerful magic. See for yourself if you can find out what is so strange about this dog. 
		<br> 
		Once, you're done playing with the dog, you will arrive at the end of this journey. This is your day <b>Sudhang</b>, enjoy it to the fullest!

		<div class="text">I love you dumbo. And I want you to have the bestest of the best birthdays possible. Now, I can't personally ensure that, but <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/quarantine-birthday-ideas-ways-to-celebrate.html" style="color: #357cf0">here</a> is a list of things that I found online that might help.<br>
			I had really hoped that I could add JS into this but I couldn't complete my course on time:( .Anyways, I like to call this place "SuddhuLand" (Please feel free to rename it whatever you like). I have tried to fill it with things I think you might like. (And even if not, you still have Sakurai arriving in a day or two, so <insert_shrug_emoji_here>).<br>
			Enjoy your day, Suddhu. You, of all the people I know deserve to have the most awesomest birthday (and life). You are THE BEST :)
